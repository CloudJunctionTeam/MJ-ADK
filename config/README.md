# How to Get the Most Recent FSC Package IDs

While we try our best to keep this repo up-to-date, sometimes we're a little bit behind when it comes to updating the Package IDs for the FSC managed, unmanaged, and Einstein Analytics (nee Wave) packages.

If you find yourself in need of the most recent package IDs, here's how you get them.

## FSC Package Install Custom Links

There are three custom links that *should* always redirect to the installation URL of the most current package version associated with that link:

* **FSC Managed Package:** http://industries.force.com/financialservicescloud
* **FSC Unmanaged Package:** http://industries.force.com/financialservicescloudextension
* **Einstein Analytics (Wave) for FSC Managed Package:** http://industries.force.com/financialservicescloudwave


## Getting the Package Version ID from the Install Link

Here's the easiset way to get the package version IDs from the custom links shared above.

1. Make sure your browser's incognito/private window is not already logged into **any** Salesforce org
2. Right-click on one of the links above and use your browser's equivalent of "open link in private/incognito window"
3. Using the screenshot below as a guide, copy the Package Version ID (aka the "04t" ID) from the end of the URL
4. Repeat this process for the other FSC package install links
